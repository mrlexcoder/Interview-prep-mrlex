What is JavaScript (JS)?

JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive
(buttons, forms, API calls, animations, etc.).

Is JavaScript single-threaded or multi-threaded?

👉 JavaScript is SINGLE-THREADED

That means:

One thread

One call stack

One task runs at a time

What is Single Thread?

Single thread = one worker

Example:

Do task A

Finish task A

Then do task B

What is Multi Thread?

Multi thread = many workers

Example:

Task A and Task B run at the same time

Used in:

Java

C++

Operating systems

Why JavaScript is single-threaded? (VERY IMPORTANT)

JavaScript works with the DOM (web page UI).

If multiple threads changed the page at the same time:

Data conflict

UI bugs

Page crash

👉 To keep things simple and safe, JS is single-threaded.

Then how does JS handle multiple tasks?

Using asynchronous behavior, not real multi-threading.

Example:

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hi");
}, 1000);

console.log("Hello");


Output:

Hello
Hi


JS does not wait — it continues.

How can JS do “multi-thread” work?

Not directly, but by using helpers:

Browser

Web Workers → background threads

Node.js

Worker Threads → real threads

JS sends work → worker thread → gets result back.

Simple interview answer (perfect) 🔥

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it executes one task at a time. It is single-threaded to safely handle the DOM. However, it can perform multi-thread-like work using Web Workers in browsers and Worker Threads in Node.js.
